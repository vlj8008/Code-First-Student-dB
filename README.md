# .NET Console App using Code first in C#. 

## Description:

A console app created using the code-first approach. App takes in user input, creates an entry in the database, and then displays to the user what they entered. 

## Future Improvements:

Code some try catch blocks so if exceptions occur app can deal with it gracefully rather than crashing.
